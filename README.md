CREATING A SIMPLE WORD DAY SCHEDULER

A user can store their hourly task in the application and saving it to track on their task' completion
This is very challenging since we need to store it in local storage and retrieve it from there so that closing the application will not erase the task
A code is also created to show a different color to the text area if the task has past due and adiiferent color to show that task are still in the future or later hour
I have to watch the previous class' videos and apply the learnings on this homework
Research and tutorials are an important piece to finish this homework especially with moment js that we need to downloaded codes, save it and link to the homework for it to work but still is not finish
Waiting for tutorial to get help in finishing the homework
