CREATING A SIMPLE WORD DAY SCHEDULER

A user can store their hourly task in the application and saving it to track their task' completion
This is very challenging since we need to store it in local storage and retrieve it from there so that closing the application will not erase the task
A code is also created to show a different color to the text area if the task has past due and a different color to show that task are still in the future or later hour (text area is gray if past hour, dark pink for current hour and green for future hour)
I have to watch the previous class' videos and apply the learnings on this homework
Research and tutorials are important pieces to finish this homework especially with moment js that we need to downloaded codes, save it and link to the homework for it to work but still is not finish
Waiting for tutorial to get help in finishing the homework - Tutor help me use the jquery functions instead of hardcoding the creation of divs columns and buttons and making my code DRY.
Advised by tutor that I only need moment.js code linked to my html and no need to create a lib folder because it is doing the same thing
I can now feel that I have improvements on this bootcamp even if I am still behind but still working hard to follow and grasp learnings each class and week
